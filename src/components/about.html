<h1>About Erinra</h1>

<p>Erinra is a secure password manager. The passwords are stored encrypted in your
Google drive and no passwords ever leave your browser unencrypted. The only way
to access the passwords is to know the master password for the database. In
other words you only need to trust yourself.</p>

<p>This also means that if you forget your password no one can help you restore
your passwords.</p>
